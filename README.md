# Linear Regression and Decision Trees for Regression Tasks

## Objectives

This project aims to practice the steps involved in solving a machine learning problem, data preprocessing, and building models using **Linear Regression** and **Decision Trees**. The objective is to understand the practical differences when training different models for a given problem.

### Goals:
- Gain hands-on experience in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for machine learning problems.
- Understand and apply **Multiple Linear Regression** concepts to a regression problem.
- Understand and apply **Decision Tree** concepts to a regression problem.
- Evaluate and analyze the performance of both models.
- Investigate the real-world application of classification models.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

In this project, we explore **regression tasks** using two different machine learning models:
1. **Linear Regression**: A basic and fundamental regression technique that aims to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
2. **Decision Trees for Regression**: A more complex non-linear model that creates a tree-like structure to make predictions based on learned decision rules from the data.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and prepare the dataset (missing values, outliers, scaling).
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
   
2. **Model Building**:
   - Build and train **Multiple Linear Regression** and **Decision Tree Regressor** models.
   
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate both models using metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **R-squared (RÂ²)** to compare their performance.

4. **Model Comparison**:
   - Analyze the performance differences between **Linear Regression** and **Decision Trees** for regression tasks.
